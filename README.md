# PLOP_scripts

These are the scripts I wrote during my research in the Friesner Lab, Columbia University Department of Chemistry. 
Their collective aim is to analyze outputted results from PLOP (the Protein Local Optimization Program) for prediction
of protein loop structures.

report_rankings.py can be thought of as the culmination of this work - it is the first version of a script for screening
protein loop backbones based on their predicted energy distributions and eliminating unlikely candidates, thus freeing up
computational power and improving the run-time by up to a factor of ten.
